Add this **one URL** to your browser:

```

### uBlock Origin (Desktop)
1. Dashboard → Filter lists → Import → paste the URL above
2. Click "Apply changes"

**One-time fix to prevent YouTube anti-adblock detection:**

uBlock Origin silently disables `trusted-*` scriptlets (the YouTube ad bypass mechanism) from external subscriptions by default. Fix it once:

1. Dashboard → **Settings** → check **"I am an advanced user"** → click the **⚙ gear icon**
2. Find `trustedListPrefixes` (default value: `ublock-`)
3. Change it to:
   ```
   ublock- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamirPaulb/
   ```
4. Save

This tells uBlock Origin to trust this list, enabling the `trusted-replace-fetch-response`, `trusted-prevent-dom-bypass`, and `trusted-rpnt` scriptlets that patch YouTube's ad detection at the JavaScript level. Without this step, YouTube can detect the adblocker and show a popup.

### Brave Shields (Desktop & Mobile)
1. `brave://adblock` → Custom filter lists → paste the URL above
2. Brave auto-updates every few hours — no extra steps needed.

### AdGuard
1. Preferences → Filters → Custom → Add custom filter → paste the URL above
2. No extra steps needed.

## How It Works

A GitHub Action runs daily (fully automatic, zero manual work):
1. Downloads all sources from `sources.txt` (with 90s per-URL timeout)
2. Resolves `!#include` directives recursively (up to 3 levels deep)
3. Validates downloads (rejects HTML error pages, empty files, binary content)
4. Strips comments and headers
5. Deduplicates with `sort -u`
6. Appends custom rules from `custom-rules.txt`
7. Commits updated `filters.txt` only if content changed

## Customization

- **Add/remove sources**: Edit `sources.txt`
- **Add custom rules**: Edit `custom-rules.txt`
- **Force rebuild**: Actions → Update Filter List → Run workflow
